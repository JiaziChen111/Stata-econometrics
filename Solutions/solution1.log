> * Q1: Write down two important causal questions that one could potentially use
>  this data to explore?
> 
> * Answer1: 
> * What is the effect of school district spending on students' test scores?
> * What is the effect of computer access on students' test scores?
> * What is the effect of district size on students' test scores?
> * Would greater family income increase school district spending?
> 
> * Q2: Write down two important non-causal questions that one could potentially
>  use this data to explore?
> 
> * Answer2:
> * Do poorer districts have fewer school resources (spending, computers)?
> * What is the relationship between the student-teacher ratio and test scores?
> * Do larger districts tend to be more urban? 
> * How highly correlated are different types of school resources (spending, com
> puters per student, student-teacher ratio) across districts?
> * How does this relationship differ in urban vs. rural districts?
> 
> * Q3: Pick one of your causal questions from above. What is an ideal experimen
> t that you could use to answer it?
> 
> * Answer3: 
> * What is the effect of school district spending on students’ test scores?
> * To answer this, the Federal government could randomly select some districts 
> (the treatment group) to receive large grants that would enable them to increa
> se spending.
> * The spending in other districts (the control group) would be held fixed at i
> ts level prior to the experiment.
> * Students’ test scores in each district would be assessed prior to randomizat
> ion and also several times afterwards.
> * The effect of district spending on test scores can be estimated by comparing
>  the test score difference between the two groups sometime after the grants we
> re made.
> * If the randomization was good, there should be no difference in test scores 
> (or any other variable) between the treatment and control groups before the ex
> periment.
> * This set-up would provide an estimate of the effect of district spending in 
> general.
> * To determine whether it is teacher salaries, classroom size, computers, infr
> astructure, etc that is behind the relationship, one would need to specify tha
> t the grants be used for that specific purpose, rather than spent however dist
> ricts wanted to.

. * First, load the dataset;
. use "\Desktop\assignment1.dta", clear;

. * Q6a) How many total districts are in the dataset?
> * To answer Q6a, describe the dataset. This will tell you how many observation
> s
> * are in the dataset. Each observation corresponds to a district;
